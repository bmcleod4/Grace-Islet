Welcome to the wonderful country of Adan&#39;Ak. You are Sarry Blawsky, 57, owner of a moderately successful headlight fluid business located in the bustling capital of the landlocked state of Cowberta. Having dedicated most of your life to the production and enhancement of headlight fluid technology, you find yourself thinking of a serene retirement on the coast of the eastern state, Besalish Colombusia (or B.C. for short), even though you have never visited the area and know nothing of local customs.

This is your wallet: $$$$$

What do you do?

Your old bones begin to ache. You lust for the salty air on the coast of Besalish Colombusia. Your knees creak with each of the eleven steps between your desk and private elevator. Maybe it&#39;s time to retire. Gain $.

You start making your preparations. Deciding that no existing home can properly make the statement of wealth that your accomplishments embody, you contact the best realtors in Besalish Columbusia. They bombard you with potential residentially zoned properties ready for development.

Your secretary took the liberty of installing a robotic chair that carries you from your elevator to your desk. As your mind begins to fade in and out with each passing day, your business decisions become less and less sound. Your company&#39;s stock plummets, and you begin to receive numerous lawsuits for selling shoddily made and malfunctioning units of headlight fluid. You fall into a deep depression as the board of directors starts to throw you weekly retirement parties, despite your insistance on staying with the company.

Your liquor cabinet begins to empty. You hardly go into the office anymore. Your wife, who left you long before you began to thing of retirement, is the only parental figure in your children&#39;s lives. There are whispers that the board is looking to perform a hostile takeover, and are willing to play dirty. You don&#39;t trust anyone anymore. You don&#39;t take visitors, and when you do go into the office, you can feel the eyes of your former admirering employees as boisterous conversations fall to hushed whispers and sideways glances.

Liver cancer. Stage 4. Your golden tan was actually advanced stages of jaundice. The doctors say there&#39;s no hope for recovery, and your age disqualifies you from the possibility of a transplant. Your mother invites you to one of her baked sales, and says it will help. You don&#39;t see how. You fall from the chair on your way to your desk the next day. You wake up in pain in a private room at the hospital. Doctors stick you with needles daily. Each beep of the thirteen machines they have you plugged into wracks your head with a throbbing pain. The nurse tells yo that your medication is already maxed out. You feel the life leaking from your body.

EcLay informs you that your property is almost definitely an ancestral burial ground and sacred place for the local indigenous people.

Emric EcLay offers his services as a consultant and shows you the property through the eyes of the local indigenous Besalish Colombusians. He explains the importance of not just the burial rocks, but the entire area as a whole for the worship of their ancestors.

Your new consultant friends hastly examine some of the disturbed areas without supervision from the R.A.S.P. or B.C.A.B., and determine that no human remains were disinterred during your unpermitted alterations. You are fined a small amount for breach of permit, but your permit is not revoked and construction can continue under supervision. The government of Besalish Colombusia offers to buy the property back from you for more than your initial buying price plus the cost of the site examination.
