                    <h3>Modern Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Visible from the docks in Ganges Harbour, Grace Islet is a small land mass just off the East Coast of Salt Spring Island. In 1990, the Edmonton-based owner of the now-defunct novelty shop San Francisco Gifts; Barry Slawsky, purchased the property. However, this is not where the story of Grace Islet begins. Provincial records state that the islet has been part of Coast Salish traditional territory since time immemorial. More specifically, the islet was part of the village of Shiyahwt (Hul’qumi’num), or SYOWT (Sencoten). Its traditional name; shmukw’elu, roughly translates from Hul’qumi’num to “a place to have funerals and containers (for bodies)”. This continued to be its only recorded purpose until 1966, when the Ganges Harbour village site was first recorded by Donald Abbot. Grace Islet was a part of the observed site. Studies of the site continued to occur over the years, recording the shell midden deposit and cataloguing artifacts collected by local residents. Sometime between 1974 and 1989 the property was rezoned “Islet Residential”. In 1989 the property acquires the legal means to allow hydro, sewage, and electrical services to be instated on the islet. It even gets its own parking space at Grace Point. Siting the beautiful location as a selling point, Slawsky bought the property the following year. </p>
                <img src="img/summaryintro.jpg" style="width:944px; height:283.5px;">
                    <p>Fast-forward to April of 2006, when kayakers discover human remains exposed near the water on Grace Islet. During an interview with CBC Radio in June 2014, an archaeologist for the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group, Eric McLay, recounted his findings from his investigation of the site when the remains were discovered 8 years prior. McLay found that the remains were that of an adult and a sub-adult. Near the shoreline he also found what appeared to be the burial cairn of the two deceased individuals, and upon further investigation inland he uncovered two more previously unidentified cairns. McLay expressed his shock when he discovered that the land did not belong to the crown, but was in fact a privately owned property. His official recommendation was that the remains would be returned to the Coast Salish community and reinterred. </p>
                    <h3>The Begininning of the Dispute</h3>
                    <p>A letter was sent to Slawsky, informing him that cairns were found, and that the entire islet was under the protection of the Heritage Conservation Act, and that before any development of the islet took place an Archaeological Impact Assessment (AIA) would have to take place. Provincial records show that over the next year, Slawsky went through channels to have the AIA performed. In March of 2007, the AIA took place over three days, being led by two contracted archaeologists hired by Slawsky from Bastion Group Heritage Consultants and representatives of the Tsartlip, Tseycu, Tsawout and Cowichan Tribes First Nations. Fifteen rock features and two locations containing human remains were identified during the process. In 2010 the AIA was finalized and submitted alongside an architect’s plans to build Slawsky’s retirement home. The final report recommends that all burial cairns be protected from disturbance.</p>
                    <p>Construction soon began in 2011 after an alteration permit was issued to Slawsky and Kevin Twohig of Terra Archaeology, who was hired by Slawsky to be his archaeological consultant. In July 2012, the Penelakut Tribe alleged that Slawsky had breached the protection of the Heritage Conservation Act by performing “unmonitored ground disturbing activity”, an act that also breached the conditions of his alteration permit. Kevin Twohig stated he was not on site for any ground disturbing construction that had taken place, as well as that he was unaware that any land clearance had happened at all. An investigation of the islet revealed that unmonitored disturbance had indeed taken place, but had avoided all recorded burial cairns. However, the cairns were avoided by a narrow margin, as the set perimeter was supposed to be 2m from each structure.  In some cases, the actual clearance was closer to 2mm. Slawsky attempted to avoid the cairns by covering them with plywood, then in some cases covering their new “protective” layer with cement. Two cairns were found straddling the foundation of the house, and construction blueprints revealed that the house would be erected right on top of them. Another cairn was found to be situated inside the houses foundation, so that once construction was completed it would be completely blocked off and inaccessible. Robert Morales, a lawyer and negotiator with the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group, insisted that what Slawsky was doing violated the Heritage Conservation Act, saying that “[u]nder the HCA, it says that a person must not desecrate or alter a burial place ... desecrate means to insult something that is holy, to damage something sacred, to damage something that is revered. Building a house on a gravesite is an insult to something that is considered holy to the Coast Salish People”. </p>
                    <p>It should be noted that throughout the construction process Slawsky has refused to acknowledge that his property contained First Nations burial cairns. When criticized about building on a First Nations cemetery, he chose to say “nothing could be further from the truth”, claiming that “a single femur fragment” wasn’t substantial evidence that the rock features on his property were burial cairns. This is despite the evidence of multiple internments containing the remains of people of differing ages and sex. Archaeologist Darcy Mathews, an expert on burial cairns, was disturbed to hear Slawsky’s claims, stating that the cairns on Slawsky’s property were consistent with thousands of other cairns that had been found in Coast Salish territory, adding that the cairns were only during a certain period, and that there was a likelihood they only represented a fraction of the gravesites on Grace Islet. </p>
                    <p>Slawsky’s understanding of the burial grounds, in addition to being met with skepticism from a burial cairn expert, also contradicts recorded history. During contact, Lieutenant Richard Mayne recorded his encounters with the indigenous people, and noted the presence of burial grounds at Grace Point in 1860 (Arnett 2011). If, at contact, this place was considered a burial ground or cemetery, its cultural significance and spiritual importance could only have increased over these last 150 years. By examining the name of the site, we can also see that it has served the same purpose long before contact since time immemorial. In face of the overwhelming evidence that the site is an indigenous burial ground, as well as repeated insistence by local Coast Salish groups of that fact, Slawsky maintains his delusional attempt to claim there is no proof of the existence of graves on Grace Islet.</p>
                    <h3>Taking Action</h3>
                    <p>Compounded by Slawsky’s unwillingness to acknowledge their ancestral graves and continued disregard and desecration of the site, many First Nation Groups and supporters took to the water to protest. In July 2012 Penelakut, Tsartlip and Cowichan Tribes elders and staff visited Grace Islet to inspect the construction site. Days later the Penelakut Tribe filed an official complaint with the RCMP to spur an investigation of Slawsky and his contractors for conducting unmonitored ground disturbing activities, violating the Heritage Conservation Act in the process. In October 2012 Slawsky’s consulting archaeologist distanced himself from the project by removing himself as joint holder. A new permit was issued with the condition that Slawsky must allow for examination of disturbed sites resulting from unmonitored excavation. Slawsky hired Madrone Environmental Services in the spring of 2013 to perform the examination. Madrone later reported that no additional remains were found and that the archaeological features had not been disturbed. This report was fought against by the Penelakut tribe, as they believed that the majority of disturbed soil remained unexamined, the report fails to acknowledge any ethnographic or cultural context the site contains, and that the report was worded to downplay the level of desecration committed during the unmonitored construction.</p>
                    <p>Complaints that he was breaching the terms of his permit continued to be filed against Slawsky. BC Forests Minister Steve Thomas refused to intervene with the project because there was no reason to believe that Slawsky had breached the permit requirements. This is after Slawsky’s permits were suspended in 2012 due to his breach of permit conditions by performing unmonitored ground disturbance. The provincial government wasn’t stepping in to protect the heritage site, so there was a push for the Capital Regional District (CRD) to acquire the property through BC’s Expropriation Act, giving them full control over the property after compensating Slawsky for the market value of the. Despite overwhelming public support, the proposal sidelined, leaving the fate of Grace Islet undetermined for a time. The CRD had chosen the path of caution rather than leadership after Slawsky’s lawyer explained the potential for legal ramifications should the CRD choose to expropriate. Construction continued during the summer and fall amidst indigenous and non-indigenous protestors alike, and in September of 2014, Slawsky filed a lawsuit against the protestors for trespassing, although it was quickly dropped.</p>
                    <h3>Settlement</h3>
                    <p>In the new year, the province picked up negotiations where the CRD left off to purchase Grace Islet from Slawsky, and settled on a number in February 2015. Slawsky would receive $5.45-million in exchange for the property. $850K was for the property itself, while another $4.6-million was paid in damages for costs incurred over Slawsky’s quarter-century ownership of the property, as well as the loss of future opportunities to enjoy the his retirement islet (Stueck 2015). BC taxpayers are also footing the bill for the removal of construction materials and the concrete encasements of the burial cairns.</p>
