                    <h3>Modern Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Visible from the docks in Ganges Harbour, Grace Islet is a small land mass just off the East Coast of Salt Spring Island. In 1990, the Edmonton-based owner of the now-defunct novelty shop San Francisco Gifts; Barry Slawsky, purchased the property. However, this is not where the story of Grace Islet begins. Provincial records state that the islet has been part of Coast Salish traditional territory since time immemorial. More specifically, the islet was part of the village of Shiyahwt (Hul’qumi’num), or SYOWT (Sencoten). Its traditional name; shmukw’elu, roughly translates from Hul’qumi’num to “a place to have funerals and containers (for bodies)”. This continued to be its only recorded purpose until 1966, when the Ganges Harbour village site was first recorded by Donald Abbot. Grace Islet was a part of the observed site. Studies of the site continued to occur over the years, recording the shell midden deposit and cataloguing artifacts collected by local residents. Sometime between 1974 and 1989 the property was rezoned “Islet Residential”. In 1989 the property acquires the legal means to allow hydro, sewage, and electrical services to be instated on the islet. It even gets its own parking space at Grace Point. Siting the beautiful location as a selling point, Slawsky bought the property the following year. </p>

                    <hr class="black">
                    <p>Fast-forward to April of 2006, when kayakers discover human remains exposed near the water on Grace Islet. During an interview with CBC Radio in June 2014, an archaeologist for the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group, Eric McLay, recounted his findings from his investigation of the site when the remains were discovered 8 years prior. McLay found that the remains were that of an adult and a sub-adult. Near the shoreline he also found what appeared to be the burial cairn of the two deceased individuals, and upon further investigation inland he uncovered two more previously unidentified cairns. McLay expressed his shock when he discovered that the land did not belong to the crown, but was in fact a privately owned property. His official recommendation was that the remains would be returned to the Coast Salish community and reinterred. </p>
                    <hr class="black">
                    <h3>The Begininning of the Dispute</h3>
                    <p>A letter was sent to Slawsky, informing him that cairns were found, and that the entire islet was under the protection of the Heritage Conservation Act, and that before any development of the islet took place an Archaeological Impact Assessment (AIA) would have to take place. Provincial records show that over the next year, Slawsky went through channels to have the AIA performed. In March of 2007, the AIA took place over three days, being led by two contracted archaeologists hired by Slawsky from Bastion Group Heritage Consultants and representatives of the Tsartlip, Tseycu, Tsawout and Cowichan Tribes First Nations. Fifteen rock features and two locations containing human remains were identified during the process. In 2010 the AIA was finalized and submitted alongside an architect’s plans to build Slawsky’s retirement home. The final report recommends that all burial cairns be protected from disturbance.</p>
                    <hr class="black">
                    <p>Construction soon began in 2011 after an alteration permit was issued to Slawsky and Kevin Twohig of Terra Archaeology, who was hired by Slawsky to be his archaeological consultant. In July 2012, the Penelakut Tribe alleged that Slawsky had breached the protection of the Heritage Conservation Act by performing “unmonitored ground disturbing activity”, an act that also breached the conditions of his alteration permit. Kevin Twohig stated he was not on site for any ground disturbing construction that had taken place, as well as that he was unaware that any land clearance had happened at all. An investigation of the islet revealed that unmonitored disturbance had indeed taken place, but had avoided all recorded burial cairns. However, the cairns were avoided by a narrow margin, as the set perimeter was supposed to be 2m from each structure.  In some cases, the actual clearance was closer to 2mm. Slawsky attempted to avoid the cairns by covering them with plywood, then in some cases covering their new “protective” layer with cement. Two cairns were found straddling the foundation of the house, and construction blueprints revealed that the house would be erected right on top of them. Another cairn was found to be situated inside the houses foundation, so that once construction was completed it would be completely blocked off and inaccessible. Robert Morales, a lawyer and negotiator with the Hul’qumi’num Treaty Group, insisted that what Slawsky was doing violated the Heritage Conservation Act, saying that “[u]nder the HCA, it says that a person must not desecrate or alter a burial place ... desecrate means to insult something that is holy, to damage something sacred, to damage something that is revered. Building a house on a gravesite is an insult to something that is considered holy to the Coast Salish People”. </p>
                    <hr class="black">
                    <p>It should be noted that throughout the construction process Slawsky has refused to acknowledge that his property contained First Nations burial cairns. When criticized about building on a First Nations cemetery, he chose to say “nothing could be further from the truth”, claiming that “a single femur fragment” wasn’t substantial evidence that the rock features on his property were burial cairns. This is despite the evidence of multiple internments containing the remains of people of differing ages and sex. Archaeologist Darcy Mathews, an expert on burial cairns, was disturbed to hear Slawsky’s claims, stating that the cairns on Slawsky’s property were consistent with thousands of other cairns that had been found in Coast Salish territory, adding that the cairns were only during a certain period, and that there was a likelihood they only represented a fraction of the gravesites on Grace Islet. </p>
